# Connect_4_Consol
My first programming project ever.
## How to compile ?

**First install MinGW GCC Compiler**

_**then just write that piece of code in a consol or a bash in the same Directory.**_

`g++ -o CONNECT_FOUR_CONSOL.exe source.cpp`

`.\CONNECT_FOUR_CONSOL.exe`

_*Tested on **gcc version 10.3.0 (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project)***_

**Have Fun Dude !**
